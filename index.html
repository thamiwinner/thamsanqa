            <h1>My Software Development Journey</h1>
            <h2>Foundations</h2>
            <p>My software development journey began with a Diploma in Business Information Technology, followed by a BCom in Information Systems at the University of Johannesburg. These programs laid a strong foundation in both technical skills and business acumen, crucial for navigating the tech industry.</p>
            
            <h2>Web Development Skills</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies, I gained proficiency in various web development languages, including <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, essential for creating interactive and visually appealing websites. I also explored frameworks such as <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for responsive design and <strong>React</strong> for building dynamic user interfaces.</p>
            
            <h2>Backend Development</h2>
            <p>To manage server-side development, I learned <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Node.js</strong>, allowing me to create robust backend solutions. I further developed my database skills with <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>NoSQL</strong> databases like <strong>MySQL</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, essential for data management in full-stack applications.</p>
            
            <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
            <p>Version control tools, particularly <strong>Git</strong>, became vital in my development workflow, enabling collaboration and efficient code management. I also utilized software tools like <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> for coding, <strong>Postman</strong> for API testing, and <strong>Figma</strong> for UI/UX design, enhancing my ability to deliver user-centric applications.</p>
            
            <h2>Continuous Growth</h2>
            <p>My education and hands-on projects equipped me with the skills necessary to build fully developed websites, from front-end design to back-end integration. This journey has ignited my passion for continuous learning and adapting to new technologies, shaping me into a well-rounded developer ready to tackle real-world challenges in the software industry.</p>

                    <h3>Project 1: Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
                    <p>This project involved creating a personal portfolio website to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences. The goal was to design an interactive and visually appealing site that would serve as an online resume. <strong>Technologies used:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript.</p>
                    <p>I used <strong>HTML</strong> for structuring the content, ensuring it was accessible. With <strong>CSS</strong>, I created a responsive design using Flexbox and Grid, and incorporated animations to enhance user engagement. <strong>JavaScript</strong> added interactivity, featuring a dynamic project gallery and smooth scrolling navigation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Project 2: Task Management Application</h3>
                    <p>I developed a task management application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, helping them organize their daily activities. <strong>Technologies used:</strong> React, Node.js.</p>
                    <p>Using <strong>React</strong>, I built a responsive interface with components for task lists and management. The backend was developed with <strong>Node.js</strong> and Express, enabling CRUD operations and user authentication, while data was stored in a MongoDB database.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Project 3: E-commerce Website</h3>
                    <p>This project focused on building a fully functional e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to their cart, and make purchases. <strong>Technologies used:</strong> Python, Django.</p>
                    <p>Using <strong>Django</strong>, I developed a backend to manage products and user data, implemented product listings with filtering options, and created a shopping cart. I integrated a third-party payment gateway for secure transactions and learned about RESTful API design and security practices.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My software development journey began with a Diploma in Business Information Technology, followed by a BCom in Information Systems at the University of Johannesburg. These programs laid a strong foundation in both technical skills and business acumen, crucial for navigating the tech industry.

Throughout my studies, I gained proficiency in various web development languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are essential for creating interactive and visually appealing websites. I also explored frameworks such as Bootstrap for responsive design and React for building dynamic user interfaces.

To manage server-side development, I learned PHP and Node.js, allowing me to create robust backend solutions. I further developed my database skills with SQL and NoSQL databases like MySQL and MongoDB, essential for data management in full-stack applications.

Version control tools, particularly Git, became vital in my development workflow, enabling collaboration and efficient code management. Additionally, I utilized software tools like Visual Studio Code for coding, Postman for API testing, and Figma for UI/UX design, which enhanced my ability to deliver user-centric applications.

My education and hands-on projects equipped me with the skills necessary to build fully developed websites, from front-end design to back-end integration. This journey has ignited my passion for continuous learning and adapting to new technologies, shaping me into a well-rounded developer ready to tackle real-world challenges in the software industry.</p>
